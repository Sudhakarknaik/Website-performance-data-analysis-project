        This project analyzes website performance metrics using session data segmented by traffic sources (channels) such as Direct, Organic Search, Email, Referral, Organic Video, and others. The goal is to derive insights into user behavior, engagement trends, and strategies for improving traffic and session quality across channels.

🎯 Objectives
       Understand how users are engaging with the website across different marketing channels.

       Identify high-performing and underperforming traffic sources.

Analyze key metrics such as:

    Engagement time per session

    Number of engaged vs. non-engaged sessions

    Provide actionable recommendations to improve traffic and engagement.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
        Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, NumPy)

        Jupyter Notebook

        Visualization: Seaborn and Matplotlib for data storytelling

📈 Key Analyses Performed
        Traffic Source Analysis

        Identified channels bringing the most vs. least users.

        Engagement Time Insights

        Found Organic Video has the highest average engagement time, indicating high-quality or long-form content effectiveness.

        Engagement vs. Non-engagement

        Compared session types across channels.

        Hourly/Date-wise Traffic Pattern

        Identified peak usage around specific dates (April 17–18).

        Useful for seasonal or campaign-related impact analysis.

         

📌 Insights & Recommendations
                 Organic Video drives deep engagement—invest in more video content.

                 Email and Referral channels show engagement gaps—consider segmentation and personalized targeting.

                 Unassigned & Gmail traffic is low—improve tracking mechanisms (UTM tags, campaign tracking).

                 Optimize high-user but medium-engagement channels (like Direct & Organic Search) to increase session duration.


📚 Future Enhancements
             Automate monthly performance reports

             Integrate with Google Analytics API for real-time data

             Add conversion funnel and bounce rate analysis

             Deploy on Streamlit for interactive dashboarding
